            <h1>Norwegian Forest Cat</h1>
            <p>
                The Norwegian Forest Cat (Norwegian: Norsk skogkatt or Norsk skaukatt) is a breed of domestic cat originating in Northern Europe.
                This landrace breed is adapted to a very cold climate, with a top coat of long, glossy hair and a woolly undercoat for insulation.
                The breed's ancestors may have been a landrace breed of short-haired cats brought to Norway about A.D. 1000 by the Vikings,
                who may also have brought with them long-haired cats, like those ancestral to the modern Siberian and Turkish Angora.

            <h1>Ragdoll</h1>
            <p>
                The Ragdoll is a breed of cat with a distinct colorpoint coat and blue eyes.
                Its morphology is large and weighty, and it has a semi-long and silky soft coat.
                American breeder Ann Baker developed Ragdolls in the 1960s.
                They are best known for their docile, placid temperament and affectionate nature.
                The name Ragdoll is derived from the tendency of individuals from the original breeding stock to go limp and relaxed when picked up.
                The breed is particularly popular in both the United Kingdom and the United States
